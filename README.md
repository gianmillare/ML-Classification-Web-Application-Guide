# ML-Classification-Web-Application-Guide

A course tutorial on how to deploy a machine learning model into a Flask App. I've recently completed several machine learning projects, but still had no clue as to how to launch the machine learning models onto a web application. 

This repository contains the code I used in a course titlesd [Deploy Models with TensorFlow Serving and Flask](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deploy-models-tensorflow-serving-flask/home/welcome). 

Note: This is just a guide to use for future machine learning models I want to deploy. The code found here is minimal.
